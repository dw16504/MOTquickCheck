// This application is a calculator to evaluate pilot compliance for FAR part 117
// Compliance.

// Tha Application will take duty and reserve start times and return an estimated or
// Actual MOT time based on existing FAR 117 rules.

// TODO: --

// the brand coloring needs to be set and evauated for the Uncanoonun logos.



// I think the Segment view controller view is too wide.

// For some reasson, two digit segment entries are degaulting to hour plus first minute digit. Fix this.

// The button seems to be cut of on the bottom on the horizontal segment list

// There is a crash occurance on the delete segment feature that needs to be teased out

// See if you cant clear out the layout flags.



// THINGS TO DO ON THE SEGMENT LIST PAGE



// 2.) Set Errors and color segment when triggered

// 4.) have the total recalculate when a segment is deleted

// 5.) see if you can get the model to save.

// TODO: Restart here, I think the top list needs to be cleaned up.

// I think the Segment View Controler is updateing the placeholder text and not the actual value in the field, unlike the Main view, I am basing this assumtion on the fact that the color changes on the main screen, and not the segment list controler./

// Core Location set up on inital start, I dont think it works until the user allows location permissions. I believe this will cause a crash the first time.

// This is a modiification to trigger a Push option in Git
